Coordinated decision making and control can improve traffic efficiency while guaranteeing driving safety. This paper proposes a formation control method for multiple Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) on multi-lane roads. Firstly, a bi-level planning framework is proposed to switch the structure of the formation in different scenarios smoothly and effectively. Secondly, the relative coordinate system is established and the conflict-free relative paths are planned in the upper level. Then, multi-stage trajectory planning and tracking are modeled and solved as an optimal control problem with constraints in the lower level. Next, case study is conducted to verify the function of the proposed method in different scenarios. Finally, simulation in the lane-drop bottleneck scenario is carried out under different traffic volume and numerical results indicate that the proposed method can improve both traffic efficiency and fuel economy at high traffic volume.
